# ATG Comfort Calculator (No-Build React)

Open `index.html` in a browser. This loads React and libraries from public CDNs, so an internet connection is required.

Features:
- CSV upload
- Fixed column detection for `Hour`, `External Temperature`, and `Kantoor` zones
- Method and comfort class selection
- Occupancy days/hours
- Zone plot with comfort limits
- Excel export of summary

If the CSV column names change, update the detection logic in `index.html`.
